# Approximate Bayesian Computation of reduced-bias extreme risk measures from heavy-tailed distributions

## Abstract

<div align="justify"> Most of extrapolation methods dedicated to the estimation of extreme risk measures rely on the approximation of the excesses distribution above a high threshold by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). We propose an alternative to the GPD, called the Refined Pareto Distribution (RPD), which allows for a second-order approximation of the excesses distribution. The parameters of the RPD are estimated using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method, and reduced-bias estimators of extreme risk measures are then derived together with the associated credible intervals. The ABC estimator demonstrates impressive performance over a wide range of heavy-tailed distributions. Its usefulness is also illustrated on two data sets of insurance claims.
